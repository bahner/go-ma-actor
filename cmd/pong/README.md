# Pong

This is is a silly, but really useful actor, which only sends back a pong!
upon receiving of a 間 message.

So you can leave it on, just so that you always have something
to reply to, when testing.

The reply is configurable, so you can set it to whatever you want.
This way you san use it to test different scenarios.
